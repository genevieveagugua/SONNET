## Project Overview

Sonnet provides a minimal web experience that allows users to share a song that reminds them of someone, paired with a personal note. Each shared song is accessible via a unique, customizable link that opens a beautifully designed page displaying the song embed and the message.

People often associate meaningful moments and emotions with music, especially in romantic relationships. However, there is no simple, lightweight way to share a song along with a personal note in a dedicated, intentional space that feels special rather than just sending a plain link via chat. Sonnet solves this problem.

### Target Audience

- Couples and romantic partners
- People in long-distance relationships
- Music lovers who associate songs with memories
- Users who enjoy thoughtful, digital gifting experiences

### Core Features

- Share a song with a personal note
- Display embedded Spotify song with cover art
- Unique, shareable link for each song-note pair
- Clean, romantic, distraction-free UI
